# Product Guidelines - Otsidka Tracker

## Tone & Personality
- **Friendly Professional:** The bot acts like a supportive friend who is also highly organized. It uses clear, monospaced data formatting for precision, balanced with a warm tone and appropriate emojis (e.g., 🏫, ⏳, ✅) to make the tracking process less clinical and more encouraging.

## Communication & Notifications
- **Milestone Alerts:** Instead of constant nagging, the bot celebrates progress. It sends proactive notifications when the user hits significant weekly goal milestones (e.g., 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the 20-hour requirement).
- **Proactive Encouragement:** If a milestone is reached late in the week, the tone shifts slightly to be more supportive, acknowledging the effort required to finish the remaining hours.

## User Experience & Data Visualization
- **Visual Progress:** Progress toward the weekly goal is shown using visual bars (e.g., `[██████░░░░]`) to provide an at-a-glance status check.
- **Structured History:** Historical visit data is presented in a clean, monospaced format to ensure alignment and readability across different devices.
- **Command-Centric:** All features are easily accessible via a persistent menu or intuitive commands, minimizing the need for the user to remember specific syntax.

## Privacy & Accuracy
- **Location Integrity:** Clearly communicate when location data is received from OwnTracks and how the "school" geofence is being applied to ensure the user trusts the tracking accuracy.
